### Overall Description

The `GetTreeViewEmpMgr` function is designed to generate a hierarchical tree structure representing employee-manager relationships. This tree is built from data retrieved from a relational database and is ultimately returned as a `DataSet` that can be used for UI binding (for example, in a TreeView control). The function is implemented in VB.NET and follows a multi-step process that includes SQL query construction, data retrieval, and tree assembly.

#### Key Steps in the Process

1. **Parameter Retrieval and SQL Query Construction:**
   - **Input Parameters:**  
     The function accepts a `SessionInfo` object and a `DashboardDataSetArgs` object. These contain parameters (like `WFProfileName`, `WFScenarioName`, and `WFTimeName`) used to filter the data.
   - **SQL Query Building:**  
     A dynamic SQL query is built using a `StringBuilder`. The query retrieves employee records from the `XFW_PLP_Register` table and performs a self-join to obtain the corresponding managerâ€™s information. A `CASE` statement is used to set the manager as `NULL` when an employee is their own manager (or when no manager exists), indicating that the record should be treated as a root node.

2. **Data Retrieval:**
   - **Execution of the Query:**  
     The query is executed against the database using ADO.NET constructs. The results are stored in a `DataTable` named `"Employee"`.
   - **Logging:**  
     Throughout the process, error logging is performed to record the SQL statement and various steps of the processing, which aids in debugging and traceability.

3. **Tree Construction:**
   - **Tree Collection Initialization:**  
     An instance of `XFTreeItemCollection` is created to hold the entire tree structure (typically a collection of root nodes).
   - **Node Management with Dictionary (`nodesByName`):**  
     A `Dictionary(Of String, XFTreeItem)` is used to manage node uniqueness and quickly look up existing nodes by name. This ensures that each employee or manager is represented only once in the tree.
   - **Node Creation and Hierarchical Assembly:**
     - For each row in the `DataTable`, the code extracts the `Parent` and `Child` values.
     - A new `XFTreeItem` is created for the child node with predefined visual properties (such as text color, image source, boldness, and state).
     - If the `Parent` value is empty, the child node is added as a root node to the `XFTreeItemCollection`.
     - If a `Parent` is specified, the code checks whether a node for that parent already exists in the `nodesByName` dictionary:
       - **If it exists:** The child node is appended to the parent's children collection.
       - **If it does not exist:** A new parent node is created, added to the collection, and then the child node is appended.
     - The parent's header text is updated dynamically to reflect the number of children.
  
4. **DataSet Creation and Return:**
   - After the tree is completely built, the function calls `treeItems.CreateDataSet(si)` to convert the hierarchical tree structure into a `DataSet`.
   - The resulting `DataSet` is then returned, making it available for binding to UI components or further processing.

#### Exception Handling

The entire operation is wrapped in a `Try...Catch` block. Any exceptions encountered during the execution (e.g., during database access or tree assembly) are logged and re-thrown as custom `XFException` objects using the `ErrorHandler.LogWrite` method.

### Use Case

This function is ideal for scenarios where:
- A visual representation of an organizational structure is needed.
- There is a requirement to convert a relational data set into a hierarchical structure for display or processing.
- Developers need a reusable method for building tree structures based on database-driven employee-manager relationships.

By providing clear parameter filtering, robust logging, and modular tree construction, the code offers a maintainable solution that can be extended or customized based on specific business requirements.
